This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using strict equality.  The bug arises from JavaScript's loose equality (==) operator which performs type coercion before comparison, sometimes leading to unexpected results. The solution uses the strict equality (===) operator which prevents type coercion, leading to more reliable and predictable comparisons.
